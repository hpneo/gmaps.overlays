# gmaps.overlays

gmaps.js module to draw custom overlays.

## Install

For using with bundlers (as Browserify or Webpack):

`npm install gmaps.overlays --save`

Before `require()` this module you need to `require('gmaps.core')`.

For using directly in the browser, download the `gmaps.overlays.js` (or `gmaps.overlays.min.js`) in `dist`.

## Usage

You need to register a `<script>` tag with the Google Maps JavaScript API, then import gmaps.core.

Every Google Maps map needs a container (`<div id="map"></div>` in this demo), which needs to have width and height, and be visible (without `display: none`, for example):

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Test</title>
  <script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true"></script>
  <script src="gmaps.core.js"></script>
  <script src="gmaps.overlays.js"></script>
  <style type="text/css">
    #map {
      width: 400px;
      height: 400px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script>
    var map = new GMaps({
      el : '#map',
      lat: -12.0433,
      lng: -77.0283,
      zoom: 12
    });

    map.drawOverlay({
      lat: map.getCenter().lat(),
      lng: map.getCenter().lng(),
      layer: 'overlayLayer',
      content: '<div class="overlay">Lima</div>'
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

For more examples you can check the tests in this repo.

## Documentation

### `drawOverlay(options)`

Creates a custom overlay using HTML, adds it to the map and returns it.

The `options` object should contain:

* `lat` (number): The latitude of the position of the overlay in the map.
* `lng` (number): The longitude of the position of the overlay in the map.
* `autoShow` (boolean): Define if the overlay will be visible at the moment of being added to the map (by default is `true`).
* `layer` (string): The layer when the overlay will be added. There are 8 layers in Google Maps, which are stacked.
* `content` (string or HTML element): The overlay's content. It can be text, HTML string or HTML element.
* `click` (function): A callback called every time the overlay is clicked. If this callback is setted, the overlay will be placed in the `overlayMouseTarget` layer.
* `verticalAlign` (string): The overlay's vertical position according the coordinate in the map (defined by `lat` and `lng`). It can be `top`, `bottom` or `middle` (by default).
* `horizontalAlign` (string): The overlay's horizontal position according the coordinate in the map (defined by `lat` and `lng`). It can be `left`, `right` or `center` (by default).
* `verticalOffset` (number): The offset in pixels, in reference to the `verticalAlign`.
* `horizontalOffset` (number): The offset in pixels, in reference to the `horizontalAlign`.
* `show` (function): A custom function used to show the overlay if `autoShow` is `false`.
* `remove` (function): A custom function used to remove the overlay. By default is not required, since GMaps handles it automatically.

### `removeOverlay(overlay)`

Removes a overlay from the map and the `overlays` property. The `overlay` parameter must be a overlay created with `drawOverlay()` or one of the elements inside the `overlays` property.

### `removeOverlays()`

Remove all the overlays from the map and clear the `overlays` property.

### Events

The following methods trigger custom events. You need to add the `gmaps.events` module before using this module to work with those events:

| Method | Event |
| ------ | ----- |
| `drawOverlay` | `overlay_added` |
| `removeOverlay` | `overlay_removed` |
| `removeOverlays` | `overlay_removed` |
